## üõ†Ô∏è How to Recreate This Yourself

If you want to patch your own ACPI tables, follow the Arch Wiki guide:
üîó [Arch Linux DSDT Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/DSDT)

To dump your ACPI tables, use **RwEverything** inside Windows to grab the currently working ones.

## üì• Installation

### Get the Files

| Method       | Command |
|-------------|---------|

### 2 Copy the ACPI Patch

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/initcpio/acpi_override
sudo cp DSDT.aml /etc/initcpio/acpi_override/
```

### 3 Edit mkinitcpio.conf

```bash
sudo nano /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
```

Find the `HOOKS` line and **add `acpi_override`**, so it looks something like this:

```bash
HOOKS=(base udev autodetect modconf block filesystems keyboard acpi_override fsck)
```

sudo mkinitcpio -P
```

None as of *now*, but blame HP if any exists ;)

(also yes... touchpad and audio work... bluetooth also does... can you imagine!?)

## üöÄ Done!

Reboot your system, and you should be good to go.
